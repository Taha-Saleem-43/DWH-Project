Staging_Area

First I have created a Database named "Staging_Area"  in which the table structure is almost similar to the Source table creaation scriptts,but some may vary. In the staging area i just combined the data from the two sources removing any kind of redundancy and ensuring that the data is well populated.

In the staging area i have created 14 Tables to fullfill the needs of DW_Northwind.

Customer Table is altered later and have added the Gender column in it. (Given in creation script of Staging_area)

STG_Customer_Gender_Combined combines the different gender formats in a singal file.(Excel and csv)
Then to populate gender on STG_Customer Table we have applied a fuzzy lookup based on name between STG_Customer and STG_Customer_Gender_Combined since both have same named so they are accurately mapped.

STG_Time dimension is created based on the min and max date from orders,it will generate all the days,weeks and months between min and max date so that it is easy for analytical purposes,In the 
STG_Time we have a Timekey which is generated according to the similar provided formula in the project description.

Note: The population script of STG_time and STG_FactInternetSales are intentially placed in Visual Studio although can be run directly from Sql server.

Important Note: I have created multiple data flows such that Firstly those tables populate that are independent means they can run parallel and then their foreign key based tables.So,Recommanded not to change the flow of execution.

Creation statements are given in the Staging_area.sql.

DW_Northwind

Most of the tables are directly populated from the Staging_Dimension.

CutomerContactCategory
Have only two colmns 1 suggorgatekey--->customerContactkey and Male and Female.
We apply lookup on STG_Customer and DW_CustomerContactCategory based on Gender so that we can get a CustomerCategkey for the DW_Customers.

Similarly to populate Employee we need Employeecitykey which we get from STG_Employee having lookup with DW_Employeecity mapping on city and countary and get their corresponding surrogate key.

In the similar way, we have populated foreign keys in the "fact Table Sales" By using multiple lookups and STG_FactInernetSales.
